## üíª Building from Source

CEngine can be built using bat script

```bat
@echo off
cls

REM Kill any running instances of CEngine.exe
taskkill /F /IM CEngine.exe 2>nul
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo No running instances of CEngine.exe found.
) else (
    echo Terminated running CEngine.exe
    REM Add a small delay to ensure the process is fully terminated
    timeout /t 1 /nobreak >nul
)

```

### Build Requirements

- G++ compiler (MinGW-w64 recommended)
- Windows SDK
- DirectX 11 SDK

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Launch `CEngine.exe`
2. Click **"List Processes"** to see all running applications
3. Select your target process and click **"Attach to Process"**
4. Choose a value type (int, float, etc.) from the dropdown
5. Enter the value you want to locate and click **"Scan for Value"**
6. Wait for the scan to complete - results will appear in the table
7. Use **"Narrow Results"** with new values to filter down to the exact memory location
8. Double-click any result to modify its value


## üìö Advanced Usage

- **Memory Map**: View detailed information about memory regions including:
  - Base address and size
  - Protection flags (read/write/execute)
  - Memory state (commit/reserve/free)
  - Module association
  - Content preview

- **Scan Techniques**:
  - **Exact Value**: Find precise matches
  - **Value Range**: Search within minimum/maximum
  - **Unknown Initial**: Find values changed since first scan
  - **Changed Value**: Detect values that have changed
  - **Unchanged Value**: Identify stable memory regions
  - **Bit Pattern**: Search using hexadecimal or binary patterns
  - **Pointer Chains**: Find multi-level pointer paths (coming soon)

- **Additional Tools**:
  - Memory Map: See all allocated memory regions
  - Process Details: View information about the attached process
  - Log Console: Monitor detailed program activity
  - Settings Dialog: Configure scan behavior and UI preferences
  - Value Freezing: Lock memory values to prevent changes (coming soon)

## üîÆ Future Developments

CEngine is under active development with the following features planned for upcoming releases:

### Coming in v1.1
- **Value Freezing**: Lock memory values to prevent them from changing
- **Memory Bookmarking**: Save important addresses for future sessions
- **Pointer Scanner**: Automatically discover pointer chains to stable memory locations
- **Scripting Engine**: Basic Python integration for automated memory operations

### Coming in v1.2
- **Advanced Pointers**: Multi-level pointer scanning and manipulation
- **Disassembler View**: Examine assembly code around memory regions
- **Structure Builder**: Define and manipulate complex data structures in memory
- **Signature Scanning**: Find code patterns in memory using IDA-style signatures

### Coming in v2.0
- **Plugin System**: Extend CEngine with custom C++ or Python plugins
- **Real-Time Charts**: Visualize memory value changes over time
- **Memory Snapshots**: Save and compare full memory states
- **Remote Process Support**: Connect to processes on networked machines
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Initial Linux compatibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues and Workarounds

- **Memory Protected Area**: When scanned for Value it can result in errors such as PARTIAL READ. This means CEngine is not capable of reading the value of the protected memory address and therefore cannot write into the protected memory address.

- **Memory Access Errors**: When scanning certain protected processes, you may see error messages about inaccessible memory regions. This is normal and expected behavior due to Windows security mechanisms - CEngine will continue scanning accessible regions.

- **Performance With Large Results**: When dealing with thousands of scan results, the interface may become sluggish. Try using the "Narrow Results" function more aggressively to reduce the result set.

- **Admin Privileges**: Some processes require elevated privileges to access. Try running CEngine as administrator if you're having trouble attaching to certain applications.

- **Current Value**: When Current Value is change is may not mark it as red.

- **Auto-Detect**: Auto-Detect may be inaccurate.

## üíª System Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit recommended)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended for large scans)
- DirectX 11 compatible graphics
- Administrator privileges for best results
