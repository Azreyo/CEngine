                      LICENSE CLARIFICATION
                      
 This software is made available to you under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
 The GPL license text copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation applies to the 
 terms of use, not to the ownership of the software itself.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

                      ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER
                    
  CEngine is provided for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This software is intended 
  strictly for teaching, demonstration, and academic research purposes. The author 
explicitly prohibits any use of this software for illegal,   unauthorized, or unethical 
activities.
  
  By using this software, you agree that:
  
  1. You will only use CEngine for legal and ethical purposes, in compliance with all 
     applicable laws and regulations.
  2. You will not use this software to access or modify computer systems, programs, 
     or data without proper authorization.
  3. You will not use this software to circumvent security measures of commercial 
     games or software in violation of their terms of service.
  4. You assume all responsibility for how you use this software and any consequences 
     that may result.
  5. Any modifications, derivatives, or distributions you make must also:
     a) Be licensed under GPL-3.0
     b) Include this complete disclaimer
     c) Acknowledge Azreyo as the original author
  
  THE AUTHOR EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY MISUSE OF THIS SOFTWARE. 
  The author shall not be held responsible for any damages, legal issues, or other 
  negative consequences resulting from the use or misuse of this software, even if 
  advised of the possibility of such damages.
  
  NO WARRANTY: CEngine is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either 
  expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties 
  of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as 
  to the quality and performance of the software is with you.
  
  If you do not agree to these terms, you are not permitted to use this software.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
